# Cisco Cyber Vision Configuration For Catalyst 9300 Series

## About this guide

### Purpose

This guide describes how to perform a clean installation of Cisco Cyber Vision on:

* Cisco Catalyst 9300 Series switches.

This guide is applicable to **system Cyber Vision version 4.1.0**.

## Overview

Proposed architecture:

The architecture proposed and described in this guide is to serve as an example.  The local network engineer should be consulted before applying the parameters used in this guide.  IP addresses, port numbers and VLAN IDs for your operational environment should be verified.

The schema below explains the architecture virtually deployed in the switch to embed the sensor application. VLAN and physical port configuration will allow OT traffic to be copied and communication with the Cisco Cyber Vision Center to be established.

The communication between the Cisco Cyber Vision Center and the sensor is represented in blue on the schema. Mirrored OT traffic is represented in yellow.

The architecture in this document is meant for a switch with an embedded sensor directly connected to the Cisco Cyber Vision Center. The schema presents two types of architecture:

* one with a direct connection to the Center (link="switchport access vlan 507").
* the other with a trunk to another switch or router which is connected to the Center (link="switch mode trunk").

Multiple types of sensor installations are explained below. One method is the automated installation using the Sensor Management extension within the Cyber Vision Center; this is the preferred method for installing sensors, which possible. This method requires access for the Cisco Cyber Vision Center to connect and authenticate to the switche's Local Manager GUI interface . Several solutions exist:

having the Center on the same subnet than the switch's Local Manager (<admin_VLAN> and <collection_VLAN> are the same).

having a route path from the Center to an <admin_VLAN> that is different from <collection_VLAN>.

Any port of the switch can be used for the communication with the Center or for OT traffic.

**Cisco Catalyst 9300 Series Switch:**

![9300 Switch](images/9300.png)

## Prerequisites

The hardware must have an access set to the Local Manager and to the CLI (ssh or console port).

**Elements to collect**

* The Cisco Cyber Vision Sensor application to collect from Cisco.com, i.e.
    * CiscoCyberVision-IOx-x86-64-<version>.tar (Cisco Catalyst 9300)
    * CiscoCyberVision-IOx-Active-Discovery-x86-64-<version>.tar (Cisco Catalyst 9300 with Active Discovery)
* A console cable, for the connection to the hardware's console port.

OR

* An Ethernet cable, for the connection to one of the hardware's port.

## Installation procedures

### Initial configuration

#### Preliminary remarks

An example of configuration is given in the following pages. Itâ€™s given to help the user to start to use a Cisco Cyber Vision Sensor embedded in a switch. More complex configurations could be needed in this case a trained user will have to configure the switch with all VLAN and port configuration needed.

#### Configure switch access

https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/switches/catalyst-9300-series-switches/series.html#~tab-documents

#### Check the software version

Check the software version using the following command in the switch's CLI: ```show version```

The displayed version must be 17.02.01 or higher to be compatible with the Cisco Cyber Vision Sensor Application.

Cisco Catalyst 9300:

![9300 Switch Version](images/9300-version.png)

If the version is lower, you must update the switch firmware. To do so, follow the links to the products page in [Configure switch access](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/cyber_vision/publications/IE3400/b_Cisco_Cyber_Vision_Network_Sensor_Installation_Guide_for_Cisco_IE3300_10G_Cisco_IE3400_and_Cisco_Catalyst_9300/m_Installation_procedures_IE3400_Catalyst_9300_v3_4_0_0.html#topic_5688).

#### SSD Disk (Catalyst 9300)

If not already done, insert a 120GB Cisco SSD disk in the SSD slot.

* You can format the SSD disk using the following command: ```format usbflash1: ext4```

![format usbflash1: ext4](images/format-flash.png)

* You can check the file system using the following command (check for ext4 and Read/Write): ```show usbflash1: filesys```

![show usbflash1: filesys](images/show-flash.png)

#### Check date and time

The internal clock of the switch must be synchronized and configured properly.

1. Check the date and time using the following command: ```show clock```

![show clock](images/show-clock.png)

2. If needed, adjust to the UTC time using the following command: ```clock set [hh:mm:ss] [month] [day] [year]```

Or go to the Local Manager:

![Local Manager](images/local-manager.png)

#### Enable IOx

Before installing the Cisco Cyber Vision sensor on the hardware, you must enable IOx.

1. Enable IOx using the following commands: ```configure terminal``` and ```iox```

![Configure Terminal](images/configure-terminal.png)

2. Check the IOx service status using the following commands: ```exit``` and ```show iox```

![Check IOx](images/show-iox.png)

#### Add the necessary configuration parameters (Catalyst 9300)

The example of configuration given below is a simple one. This configuration is only valid if a direct link exists between the Center and the switch with the embedded sensor. In this case, the dedicated port is configured with the Collection VLAN (for example, 507). In many other cases, the port used for communication between the Center and the sensor will have to be configured as trunk.

1. Open the Cisco Catalyst 9300 CLI through ssh or via the console terminal.
2. Configure a vlan for traffic mirroring using the following commands:
```configure terminal```
```vlan 2508```
```exit```
```int vlan 2508```
```ip address 169.254.1.1 255.255.255.252```
```no shutdown```
```exit```

![Configure vlan](images/configure-vlan.png)

3. Configure the AppGigabitEthernet port which will enable the communication to the IOx virtual application:
```interface AppGigabitEthernet 1/0/1```
```switchport mode trunk```
```exit```

![Configure AppGigabitEthernet port](images/configure-ethernet.png)

4. Configure the SPAN session and add to the session the interfaces to monitor:
```monitor session 1 type erspan-source```
```source interface Gi1/0/2 - 24 both```
```no shutdown```
```destination```
```erspan-id 2```
```mtu 9000```
```ip address 169.254.1.2```
```origin ip address 169.254.1.1```
```exit```
```exit```

![Configure the SPAN session](images/configure-span.png)

5. Configure one of the switch's ports to enable the communication between the virtual sensor and the Center:
```interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1```
```switchport access vlan 507```
```no shutdown```
```exit```

![Configure port](images/configure-port.png)

6. Save the configuration:
```exit```
```write mem```

![Save configuration](images/save-config.png)
